Following are this week's round of predictions from my pagerank+random forest model detailed in [the technical approach section of this post]({{ site.baseurl }}/Predicting-the-2017-College-Football-Bowl-Season/). My full-game simulation model is still a work-in-progress, so that'll have to wait for bowl season. Here's to a championship week even just 10% as exciting as last week's rivalry games!

| Prediction | Actual Result |
| #10 oregon 28<br>**#17 utah 29** |  |
| #9 baylor 15<br>**#5 oklahoma state 26** |  |
| kent state 40<br>niu 40 |  |
| utah state 17<br>**#19 s diego state 25** |  |
| appalachian state 21<br>**#24 la lafayet 35** |  |
| #1 georgia 32<br>**#3 alabama 37** |  |
| #21 houston 20<br>**#4 cincinnati 29** |  |
| **#15 pitt 38**<br>#16 wake forest (nc) 35 |  |
| **#2 michigan 27**<br>#13 iowa 18 |  |
| **usc 29**<br>cal 26 |  |

The games with the biggest playoff implications are the Big Ten, Big 12, AAC, and SEC championships:

If these games turned out as predicted here, Cincinnati might be in trouble in its attempt to be the first non-power-5 program included in the playoff. Alabama, Georgia, and Michigan would likely all stay in the top 4, and now Okalahoma State would have another quality win (by a healthy margin) on their resume. It would come down to how much more valuable the committee sees Oklahoma State's win over Baylor compared to Cincinnati's over Houston by a comparable margin. However these games shake out, I doubt we'll go into selection Sunday with very high confidence of exactly who the 4 teams will be.
